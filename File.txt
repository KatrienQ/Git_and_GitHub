- Git keeps track of timeline of your commits (mostly local), GitHub is a hosting service (cloud-based)

- Structure
    - My computer
        - Develop area (folder where the project is developed, where documents are in)
        - Local repository (= Git that is organizing for you)
        - Staging area (= channel/location that will help in preparing the documents from the develop area for staging)

- Meaningful messages
    - Why was it changed
    - How this addresses the issue
    - Effects dut the change
    - Limitations of the change
    
    → Be descriptive!
    
- Saving a point in time
    - Add to staging area
    ```bash
    $git add File
    ```
    - Commit
    ```bash
    $git commit -m "meassage"
    ```
    → You can also do this in ungit, but less recommended for complex projects
